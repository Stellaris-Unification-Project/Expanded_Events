New Origins:
- From Ashes, Machine's creators destroyed themselves, leaving their robots to pick up the pieces, starts on tomb world, get unique event chains that give rewards, model on Shoulder of Giants
	- Destroyed from War
	- Destroyed from Environmental Disaster
	- Destroyed from Cataclysmic Event
- Precursor Archive, made it to space after reverse engineering tech from old library left in system, starts with large research deposit on world and a dig site
	("Although our researchers have been studying the archival ruins for decades, we have still explored only a tiny fraction of the entire complex")
- ???, homeworld locked behind a shield. Why? How do you get out?
- ???, monolith (aka 2001 space odyssey)
- ???, starts next to a hostile empire (usually homicidal, sometimes despoilers), challenging origin, starts with 20 corvettes, but so does your rival
- Fratricide, requires xenophobe, start with tomb world of alien race you murdered, unique events, starts with a random weapon tech, and maybe first army tech
	- Maybe enemy species survived, holds a grudge (terrorism, assassinations, ext)
	- Maybe find unfired superweapon enemy tried to use against you

Changed Origins:
- Galactic Doorstep, more events, anomalies, and dig sites
	- Find old gate-builder ship or station
- Remnants get expanded colony events, find remnants of their old empire on other worlds, may spawn special systems
	- events and anomalies related to what destroyed your world
- Doomsday, death cultists, cannot be resettled, may do a terrorism

New Anomalies (random):
- Find ancient FE ship, study it, try to restore it, return it to FE in hopes of a reward
- discover stone-age primitives on world, presence wasn't obvious (what, if anything, is special about them?)
- find probe from your own species (non-human) (machine find probe from their makers)
- anomaly making fun of Jordan Peterson's 12 rules for life
- more anomalies for UHB_MOLTEN_CHART_CAT (distress signal from molten world)
- restore anomaly.6000 (rogue moon)
- restore anomaly.4000 (alien refugees, will need to remake from scratch)
- anomaly_failure.2645, singing animals, project to find out why ship disappeared

New Anomalies (game start):
- Find old star that was kept artificially alive beyond its time, but machinery is failing and it will soon explode (probably spawn with a gaia world, so player wants to try to save it, will probably require real space for supernova)

Changed Anomalies:
- anomaly.1, follow-up find fossils of space monster that left that giant fossilized poop (requires biology leader trait or chance when claiming systems)
- anomaly.60, scientist able to identify source of radiation that bombarded asteroid (requires particles trait)
- anomaly.115, use genetic material to bring back some animals back to life (requires biology or maniacal trait)
- anomaly.330 (extreme storms) follow-up: what is causing the storms?
- Add positive and negative media coverage gain to various anomalies and events
- Xenophiles leak existence of brain slugs
-If enough pops become brain slugs, may influence your empire to become more pacifist and/or xenophile

New Dig Sites (random):
- Old Galactic Market, rewards trade tech for regular, + energy modifier for gestalts (or maybe + diplo weight from economy?)
- (technology breakthrough) something stuck in time, unlocks tech_field_manipulation_breakthrough
- find evidence of past civ that used zro to get high and get "visions of the universe", gives special zro-using edict that gives +10% research(???), not available to gestalts
- Find remains of a cute-looking fanatical purifier that was surrounded by vastly technologically superior neighboring empires. Unable to purify through conquest, they resorted to drastic measures, ultimately wiping themselves out.
- Find ant mounds left by pre-ftl insectoids

New Dig Site (game-start):
- Precursors who made a deal with the Eater of Worlds, fed it slaves to sate it, did not save them in the end (world shrouded)
- Primitives actually the remant of an interstellar empire
- Find vaults of alien tech (borderlands)
- Find primitives of your species, along side another species. How did they get there?
- Primitive homeworld once colony of more advanced empire (similar to On the Shoulders of Giants)

New Dig Sites (tech):
- Last 2 energy techs: something on planet becomes quantumly entangled with power plants, leads to discovery of a hidden lab
- Gateway techs or l-gate repeatable: something gateway and nanite related, gives l-gate insight among other rewards


Old Dig Sites:
(all events are ancrel.xxxx unless stated otherwise)
invaders can investigate sentinels if previous owner did not
invaders can open sentinel tomb if sentinel armies are killed

Aliens
	- 109, follow-up, extra-dimensional nomads sounds a lot like unbidden
		- chance to find evidence of a "those-who-resist" colony when clearing tile blockers or building districts. Burried under rubble and fire-heated clay, indicating mass destruction.
Shot into the Ground
	- 9090, possible follow-up with space monster
Anyone Home
	- 9265, spawns a primitive hive mind race of fungoids after some long span of time, dies off again after several hundred years
Get to the Bottom
	- 9350, what is stored away here? (TBD)
Popular World
	- 9390, when research station built, chance to find the 10th step by special project, 12 steps total:
		- 10th step: Now the lair of pirates or some other space creature
		- 11th step: System close to going supernova (will do so with Real Space active)
		- final step: a miraculous gaia world (50% chance of being a holy world or colonized by primitives)
The Library
	- unique interactions with the Curators


Galaxy Generation
- System full of old Materialist FE drones that have gone berserk, if destroyed the FE thanks you for cleaning up their mess (or scolds you for interfering with an ongoing experiment)
	- system gives nanites, drones use grey tempest ships


Crisis Events
- Gray Tempest:
	- If curator or tech, will periodically give military techs (primarily alloy, shield, and point-defense techs) to those who do not have them
		- sell exotic gas production, asks you not to tell XuraCorp, as they are surprisingly litigious
	- If gatebuilders, after crisis can be traded with
- Swarm:
	- Develop a bioweapon effective against the swarm
	- After: shield galaxy from hunters, if failed, spawns impossibly strong star eaters (like stellerite devourers, but larger?), eats stars, causing systems to disappear
- Contingency:
	- Upload virus that makes contingency hostile with itself (some of their fleets joins the cybrex?), or generally confused
	- After: backlash against synths, might cause new problems
- Unbidden:
	- Psionics can develop advantages against them
	- After: strengthen interdimensional barriers to prevent further incursions
	

Fallen Empire Events
- FE gives "White Elephant" gift that is not as useful as it first appears (gift varies by FE)
	- Materialist: experimental tech
	- Spiritualist:
	- Xenophile: gives bad pops to take care of, with unique trait that is bad at most things
	- Machine: device to block <<<ERROR: DATA BLOCK CORRUPTED>>> signals, decreases robot job output, might actually help against the ghost signal (or might not)
- If you have a holy world in your borders, Spiritualist FE claims that your governor denied their pilgrim's passage to holy world, demands governor be fired
- Spiritualist FE rewards you for destroying robot empire
- If Spiritualist FE is patronizing, may invite a random leader to attend one of their rituals, leader comes back with the psionic trait
- Once you've researched certain milestone technologies, the Materialist FE may invite you to participate in some wild and probably unethical experiments
	- alternate dimensions (increases chance of unbidden)
	- dark matter
	- experiments on weird lifeforms
- Xenophile FE tourists make a nuisance of themselves. Xenophobes are especially annoyed, while gestalts are generally confused by their antics
- Materialists demand you stop researching a dangerous technology (player only)
- Xenophobe FE will rarely ask you to wage war on rival with xeno-compatability, will give a reward if you attack (no opinion boost), angry if you do not
- If you have 50k+ fleet power and are neighboring the Xenophobe FE's neutral zone, they may get paranoid and accuse you of suspicious ship movements near their border, demand you allow them to send observers to your fleet, giving malus to fire rate and sublight speed for a year
- Attacking machine FE will mark you as their rival, they assume you are allied with or have been corrupted by the contingency
- If FE loses too many ships, will fire up shipyards to replenish fleet. Chance of awakening each time this happens
- FE may awaken as protectors against player crisis (especially against player-controlled crisis)
- Spiritualists Fe get upset if you terraform a holy world (especially to a machine world)
- Spiritualist Fe gets feels betrayed if Zarqan's prophet destroys a holy world
